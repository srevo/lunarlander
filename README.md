# Lunar Lander

## Description
Lunar Lander is a classic arcade game genre where the player controls a lunar landing module. The objective is to safely land the module on a designated landing pad on the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage fuel consumption and control the module's descent speed and orientation to achieve a soft landing. Crashing the lander or running out of fuel before landing results in a game over.

## How to Run the Game
1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Install the Pygame library. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```
3.  Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
4.  Run the game using the following command:
    ```bash
    python lunar_lander.py
    ```
    (Assuming the main game file is named `lunar_lander.py` - I'll verify this later if needed)

## Game Controls
*   **Up Arrow:** Apply thrust to the lander.
*   **Left Arrow:** Rotate the lander counter-clockwise.
*   **Right Arrow:** Rotate the lander clockwise.
*   **Spacebar:** (If applicable, e.g., for starting the game or special actions - will confirm if this is used)

## Scoring System
*   **Successful Landing:** Points are awarded for successfully landing the module on the landing pad. The quality of the landing (e.g., descent speed, accuracy) can affect the score.
*   **Fuel Remaining:** Bonus points are often awarded based on the amount of fuel remaining after a successful landing.
*   **Crash:** No points are awarded, and the game ends.

## Dependencies
*   **Pygame:** This game relies on the Pygame library for graphics, sound, and input handling. Make sure it's installed as described in the "How to Run the Game" section.
